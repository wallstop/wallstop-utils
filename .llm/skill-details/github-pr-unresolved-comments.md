# GitHub PR Unresolved Comments (Expanded)

This expanded guide supports the lightweight skill stub in `.llm/skills/github-pr-unresolved-comments.md`.

## Host Allowlist And Input Validation

Preserve GitHub utility safety, host allowlist checks, and retry semantics.

Validate host and owner/repo parameters before any network calls.

## Retry-Safe GitHub Request Flow

Keep HTTP calls inside approved wrappers and preserve retry behavior for transient status codes.

## Actionable Diagnostics And Resilience Tests

Keep diagnostics explicit and maintain coverage for URI safety, retries, and host restrictions.

## Workflow

1. Validate host and owner/repo parameters early.
2. Keep HTTP calls inside approved wrappers.
3. Preserve retry behavior for transient status codes.
4. Keep non-global IP blocks and host allowlist checks active.
